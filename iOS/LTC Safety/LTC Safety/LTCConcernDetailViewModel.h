 The LTCConcernDetailViewModel is responsible for modeling LTCConcern data in a way so that the LTCConcernDetailViewController can display the concern's data to the user. This involves setting up sections and rows to display the concern's properties.
 
 History properties: The concern in this class is subject to change.
 
 Invariance properties: This class assumes that the given viewModel is valid and non-nil and that the current concern is also valid and non-nil.
