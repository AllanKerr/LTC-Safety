/**
 The LTCPersistentContainer class is an iOS 9 compatible version of the NSPersistentContainer class introduced in iOS 9.
 Its purpose is to load a managed object model from file and set up a persistent store and managed object context that
 can be used to save and load entities in that model.
 
 History properties: Instances of this class should not vary from the time they are created.
 
 Invariance properties: This class assumes that the viewContext, managedObjectModel, and storeCoordinator are valid and non-nil.
