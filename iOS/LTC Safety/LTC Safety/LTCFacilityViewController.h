/**
 The LTCFacilityViewController class is used to provide value selection for carehome facilities. A subclass of LTCValueSelectionController is used due to limitations with the third-party XLForms library. Because only the class can be passed, it is not possible to pass a filename in the designated initializer. As a result, the fileName must be provided by subclassing LTCValueSelectionController.
